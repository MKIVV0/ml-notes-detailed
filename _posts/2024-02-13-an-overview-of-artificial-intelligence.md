The broad objective of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is analyzing and building Intelligent
Agents (IA), where the latter is able to perform tasks which, attributed to humans, are
considered intelligent, regardless of the way they are implemented (software, hardware...).
Thus, an IA is able to perceive its environment, take actions and maximize the
chances of reaching some goal. To do so, an IA should have some good characteristics,
which are:
• adaptive behavior: it must be flexible to changing environments and goals;
• learning ability: it must summarize experience and tasks are learned (not pro-
grammed)
• optimization: the goal must be reached effectively and efficiently (maximization of
an objective function)
The goal of Artificial Intelligence is to build intelligent agents to solve problems
involving thinking, perception and action.
Machine Learning is a sub-discipline of AI that provides computers with the ability
to learn a given task without being explicitly programmed and it’s characterised by:
• wide range of sub disciplines and applications, from small solutions for mobile
applications to sophisticated integrated tools for advanced applications (missions
in pace industry etc..);
• complexity: tasks are not directly formalized; we have to formalize the way to learn
the intelligent task, rather than the task itself.
